# JavaCourse
This repository contains solved homework problems from the **Basics of the Java programming language** course at the Faculty of electrical engineering and computing, held by Marko Čupić.

## Homework 1 - Introduction to Java
An introduction to the Java programming language. No object-oriented paradigm is used here; only a demonstration of how to write simple programs in Java.

## Homework 2 - Custom Collections
The concept of classes is introduced. The task was to create a custom implementation of the array-backed and the linked-list-backed collections for storing elements.
*The last task was to create a class representing complex numbers, with an additional feature to support parsing strings into complex number objects.

## Homework 3 - Lexer and Parser
The task was to createa a simple lexer and a parser for a custom script language - SmartScript.

## Homework 4 - Hash Table and Simple Database
Created an implementation of a Hash Table. This implementation uses a linked list for collision resolution.
The second task was to write a simple database emulator. The database itself is stored in a textual file, and the program allows query commands for fetching the items from the database. The loaded database contents are internally managed using the hash table from the previous problem.

## Homework 5 - Collections
The homework introduced the concept of design patterns, using the Observer design pattern, which had to used as the implementation of the first problem. The second task was to create a collection of prime numbers which, obviously, generates prime numbers. The next collection to implement was an ObjectMultistack. This thing stores objects in a map-like way, but instead of mapping a single key to a single value, it maps a key to a stack of values. Talk about abstraction... And the last thing was to use the Java Stream API for manipulating collections.
